The GeoSpeed OGC Framework allows developers to quickly integrate OGC specification support into new or existing GIS applications.

The framework provides all of the necessary infrastructure support for recieving requests from OGC compliant clients and routing those requests to developer specified implementations.

The framework currently supports the Web Mapping Service 1.3.0, Web Feature Service 1.1 and Web Feature Service Transactional 1.0, and Web Coverage Service 1.0 specifications.
